# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many employees are nearing retirement and how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program. I performed this analysis using SQL.

## Results
Here are some of the findings:

* Quite a few employees are retiring. About 73,000 out of 300,000 employees.
* About 50,000 of the retiring employees are senior employees.
* About half of the retiring employees are engineers.
* 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

# Summary
About 24% of employees are retiring. This means that Pewlett Hackard should probably start hiring more employees to make up for the loss (engineers in particular). Also, a majority of the employees who are retiring are senior employees which means they should start searching for current employees who can be promoted to senior positions. There are pleanty of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. They can help train the employees who are being promoted to senior positioins.
A "promotion_eligibilty" table that contains the employees who are eligible for a promotion could help the company find employees who can fill the senior positions.
